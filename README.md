#  Invoice Generator - Simple PDF Billing App for Local Businesses

This project is a simple but powerful **invoice generator** built in **Python**. It allows local business owners, freelancers, and service providers in **Ethiopia** (or anywhere) to create **clean, professional PDF invoices** with zero hassle.

Invoices are automatically saved and organized into **monthly folders**. You can customize the business name, phone number, logo, VAT rate, and currency. No internet required, no fancy setup - just Python and a terminal.

## Why I Built This

Hi! I'm **Zekirubel**, a young programmer from Ethiopia . I created this app to help local businesses that still write receipts by hand. With this tool, they can:

- Generate invoices quickly
- Keep a digital record of every transaction
- Look more professional and organized

It also helps me build my **programming portfolio** by solving real problems in my community.

## What Can Do it do

1. Generate printable **PDF invoices**

2. Add multiple items (name, quantity, price)

3. Automatically calculate **VAT and total**

4. Customize business info using `config.json`

5. Save invoices in folders by **month and year**

6. Works on **Mac, Windows, Linux** (just needs Python)

### Future Improvements (Coming Soon)

I plan to upgrade this project with:

1. A full web app version (mobile friendly)

2. Offline PWA support so it works like an installable app

3. Option to send invoice by email or Telegram

4. Amharic version for better local usability

5. .exe / .app version that doesn’t need Pytho
